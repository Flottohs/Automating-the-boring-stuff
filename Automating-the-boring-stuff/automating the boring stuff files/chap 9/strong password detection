'''
Write a function that uses regular expressions to make sure the password string it is passed is strong. 
A strong password has several rules: it must be at least eight characters long, contain both uppercase and lowercase characters, and have at least one digit.
Hint: Itâ€™s easier to test the string against multiple regex patterns than to try to come up with a single regex that can validate all the rules.
